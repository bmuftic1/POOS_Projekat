# Blood Cells Analysis

A project for analysing different types of blood cells in images.

The analysis of an image provided in the dataset can have three types of results:

1. *Lymphocyte*;
2. *Neutrophil*;
3. None of the above.

The model used for training and testing is the **Naive Bayes Classification Model**.

The chosen descriptor is the *HuMoments descriptor*.

Features:

- [x] Region of interest (ROI) selection;
- [x] Image noise reduction;
- [x] Image sharpness improvement;
- [x] Image quality enhancement (contrast, brightness and histogram equalization);
- [x] ROI cropping and filter applying;
- [x] Creating descriptors for images;
- [x] Model training and testing;
- [x] Model exportation;
- [x] Object detection (with or without the usage of a slider).
