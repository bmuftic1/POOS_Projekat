The model used for training and testing is the **Naive Bayes Classification Model**.

The chosen descriptor is the *HuMoments descriptor*.

Features:

- [x] Region of interest (ROI) selection;
- [x] Image noise reduction;
- [x] Image sharpness improvement;
- [x] Image quality enhancement (contrast, brightness and histogram equalization);
- [x] ROI cropping and filter applying;
- [x] Creating descriptors for images;
- [x] Model training and testing;
